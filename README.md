# Tekton-Examples

Tekton Construction Technologies is a cloud-based document management solution focused on streamlining workforce management in the construction space.

Tekton is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the project I can only provide certain portions of my code. This repo contains React. JavaScript, SQL, and C#. 

Enjoy!
